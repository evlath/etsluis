(LUIS) Labs Unified Install Script

## Description
LUIS is a template silent install script for use in the ETS-Labs MDT Infrastructure.

## Why do we need it?
LUIS will aim to verfy the successful install of a program by use of simple file/directory checks to see if a program was installed (or at least the expected files were)

## How will it work?
The first iterations of luis will check for the existance of a file. In later versions, version validation and file integraty will be verified as well.

## What will it do?
### Current
- Install program

### Planned and in progress
- Check file existance
